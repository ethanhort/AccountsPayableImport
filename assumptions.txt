dist codes file starts on line 3, ends at end of file 
	-rows with no value in program column will not be used (make sure every line of data has something in that col and that no "filler data" is 
		included in that col
	-distribution code is in col 1
	-program is in col 3
	-grant is in col 4
	-loan num is in col 5
	-fas is in col 6
	-percent is in col 7
	
when allocating equally, make sure that invoice amount is over ~$100. I think as long as it's more than (number of unique dist codes) * $1 it will be fine,
but if you start getting negative debits, this is probably why. 

pre allocated file starts on line 3, ends at end of file
